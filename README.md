# Canballs
A quick experiment using canvas and web audio.

- Click on some empty space to generate a new spawner
- Spawners will generate balls at a set interval
- Drag your mouse to create a new line
- Lines will make a sound when a ball touches them
- Click on a line to turn it in to a solid line
- Balls will bounce on solid lines
- Click on a solid line to remove it

## Browser support
- Should run on any browser having support for canvas
- Will only generate sounds when using a browser implementing the Web Audio API
